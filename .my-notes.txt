DON'T FORGET

* Remove test mode from real time database and set permissions!
* Should probably eventually remove option to create an account and restrict those who don't have accounts from accessing database resources. I could create a set of keys, one of which would need to be specified by the new user in order for them to be allowed to create a new account. For example, new users are prompted with: "Enter a secret key to create a new account: <secret_key>", and if valid, they will be allowed to create a new account.
* Update screen names and data passed between from expenses to items
* optimize imports with "type"
* Update api endpoint calls from expenses to items
